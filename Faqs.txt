1) Why do navbar menu has vertical options instead of being horizontally?

Approach:  			Right now: 

A B C D 			A
				B
				C
				D

How I fixed it?


2) Why is there a wide gap between the About me information and the content even though I have already applied a grid-gap of 1rem?

Answer: the gap was to low so it was filling the provided grid (1fr 2 fr) leaving the space. 
Fix: grid was update to 1fr 4fr.
